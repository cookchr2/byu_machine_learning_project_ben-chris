    "\"This census is for the state of New York in New York County. It's handwritten. That means a census taker came and manually entered in their information. What if he mispelled a name? How likely is that? It happens frequently. In 10 years, he goes to the same house and finds the same family there and writes down their information. Maybe there's a few more children, maybe someone's died. Or maybe the family doesn't actually live there anymore. For economists, this data on families has a lot of potential. But how can we know someone's 1910 data from just looking at their information on the 1900 census? That's the problem and what we're trying to figure out.\"\n",
